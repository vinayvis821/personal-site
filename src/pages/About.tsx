            Hi! My name is Vinay. I recently graduated with a computer science
            degree at Washington University in St. Louis with a minor in Human
            Computer Interaction ðŸ’».

          <p className="second-paragraph">
            Currently, I am an incoming New Grad SWE at Amazon AWS. Aside from
            programming, I enjoy all things fitness, cooking, binging tv and
            movies, hiking, videogames, and poker.

            The rest of this website is still in incremental development as I
            finish up my summer break and start my job; will be completed soon!
